A submission for a competition that me and my friends did around October/November 2020.
I made the entire app in this repo and my friends made the content inside it.

The `backend` folder uses Express.js, Tailwind.css, Alpine.js and the
`frontend` uses Tailwind.css and Routify.js

This repo is only used as a backup and the code is probably not good because it
has been a while ago and I've improved since then :D

(but still, hopefully you'll find something useful here :)
